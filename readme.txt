Computer Repair Shop Form Filler 

Before writing this program, there were 3 separate forms that needed to be filled out. 
Writing all the information 3x by hand is absolutely tedious and caused more failures than I would like to admit.
This program allows you to create a diagnostic, invoice, and log form for customers in one go. 
Can be modified to adapt to the business being performed, but this specifically is for the Computer Repair Shop. 

Requires installation of python-docx via terminal
Requires Docx/ODT Viewer extension

To ensure the project worked, I tried expected input formats first to make sure it would output the intended form.
I provided large data, and incorrect formatting to try to test error handling.
I also attempted to run the script multiple times with user inputs to observe consistency in getting the repair form. 

Overall, I learned how to plan and build a small Python application from scratch with testable components. 
One of the key Python concepts I explored was error handling using try/except blocks, which helped me manage unexpected user input and runtime issues more gracefully. 
I also became more comfortable using functions to keep the code reusable.
One big challenge I faced was that I have horrible procrastination tendencies. Thankfully, I overcame this by having the main portion of the code be completed before the end of the second week.
